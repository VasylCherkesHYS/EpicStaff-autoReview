# Password Recovery

Four endpoints plus a CLI fallback, all sharing a single orchestrator
(`PasswordRecoveryService`) that composes small single-purpose
collaborators. Views are thin — they call the validator for shape
checks, hand the cleaned payload to the service, and wrap the return in
a DRF `Response`. All business rules and security invariants live in
the service layer.

## Layering

```
View  ──▶  AuthValidationService.validate_*()  (shape + strength)
  │
  └────▶  PasswordRecoveryService               (orchestrator)
             │
             ├── SmtpConfigService              (is SMTP configured?)
             ├── PasswordResetTokenRepository   (token CRUD + active-ness)
             ├── PasswordResetEmailSender       (render + send, fail-silent)
             ├── PasswordWriter                 (set_password + save)
             └── SessionInvalidationService     (blacklist refresh tokens)
```

Every collaborator is injected via the orchestrator's constructor so
tests can swap in fakes without monkey-patching.

## Endpoints

### `POST /api/auth/password-reset/request/` — anonymous

Body: `{ "email": "<email>" }`.

Always returns **200** with body:

```json
{ "detail": "If the email is registered, a reset link has been sent.", "smtp_configured": true|false }
```

Behavior:

* If the email resolves to a user, inside a single transaction: all
  prior unused tokens for that user are marked `is_used=True` and a new
  `PasswordResetToken` is created. Only the most recent link works.
* If SMTP is configured (`EMAIL_HOST` set — credentials are optional
  and only used when the relay requires AUTH), the reset email is
  dispatched through `django.core.mail`. Delivery is fail-silent — a
  send error never changes the HTTP response.
* If SMTP is **not** configured, `EMAIL_BACKEND` is the console backend
  and Django prints the rendered email (with the reset link) to stdout.
  That is the documented no-SMTP recovery surface.
* If the email does not resolve to a user, no token is created and no
  email is sent, but the response body is identical.

Throttling: `PasswordResetRequestThrottle`, bucket `ip|email`, rate
`PASSWORD_RESET_REQUEST_THROTTLE_RATE` (default `5/hour`).

### `POST /api/auth/password-reset/confirm/` — anonymous

Body: `{ "token": "<uuid>", "new_password": "<pw>" }`.

* Looks up the token; if it is unknown, already used, or past
  `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_TTL` (default **900 s / 15 min**), returns a
  single generic **400**
  (`Reset token is invalid, expired, or already used.`) — the response
  body does not distinguish the three cases.
* Runs the same `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` as first-setup. Weak
  passwords return 400 with per-field errors in the standard
  `FormValidationError` shape.
* On success: password is written, token is marked used, and **every
  outstanding JWT refresh token for that user is blacklisted**. Short-
  lived access tokens still in circulation continue to work until they
  expire (bounded by `JWT_ACCESS_MINUTES`, default 15).

### `POST /api/auth/password-change/` — authenticated self-service

Body: `{ "current_password": "<pw>", "new_password": "<pw>" }`.

* Verifies `current_password`. Wrong password → 400
  (`invalid_current_password`).
* Validates `new_password` strength.
* On success: writes new password, blacklists the user's refresh
  tokens, mints a fresh `{access, refresh}` pair so the calling device
  stays logged in without a second round-trip.

### `POST /api/auth/admin/password-reset/` — superadmin only

Body: `{ "user_id": <int>, "new_password": "<pw>" }`.

* Gate: `actor.is_superadmin` — non-superadmins get 403
  (`superadmin_required`). The gate lives in the service so the CLI
  and the HTTP surface share one authorization path.
* Target user not found → 404.
* Weak password → 400 (same validators as everywhere else).
* On success: writes the new password, invalidates any pending reset
  tokens for the target, blacklists all of the target's refresh
  tokens. Returns **204**. No password is echoed — the admin supplied
  it.

## CLI fallback

```
python manage.py reset_password <email> [--generate | --password <pw>]
```

* No flag → prompts twice with `getpass` and confirms.
* `--password <pw>` → non-interactive (use with care; logs in shell
  history).
* `--generate` → generates a strong random password via
  `secrets.token_urlsafe(16)` and prints it once to stdout.
* Runs the same validators as the HTTP surface.
* Goes through `PasswordRecoveryService.cli_reset`, so the same
  post-conditions apply: password written, reset tokens invalidated,
  refresh tokens blacklisted.

Unknown email → non-zero exit with `CommandError`.

## Configuration

All env vars land in `src/.env` and are forwarded through
`src/docker-compose.yaml` to the `django_app` container.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_TTL` | `900` | Token lifetime, seconds. |
| `PASSWORD_RESET_REQUEST_THROTTLE_RATE` | `5/hour` | DRF throttle rate. |
| `EMAIL_HOST` | *(empty)* | SMTP host. Empty → console backend. |
| `EMAIL_PORT` | `587` | SMTP port. |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | *(empty)* | SMTP user. Leave blank for relays that do not require AUTH (mailpit, local Postfix). |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | SMTP password. Leave blank for relays that do not require AUTH. |
| `EMAIL_USE_TLS` | `True` | |
| `EMAIL_USE_SSL` | `False` | |
| `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` | `no-reply@epicstaff.local` | `From:` header on reset emails. |
| `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:4200` | Base of the reset link. |
| `FRONTEND_PASSWORD_RESET_PATH` | `/reset-password` | Path segment; token appended as `?token=<uuid>`. |

`EMAIL_BACKEND` is resolved at import time: SMTP when `EMAIL_HOST` is
set, else console. Whether Django authenticates against that host is
independent and keyed on `EMAIL_HOST_USER` + `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` —
both blank = no AUTH attempted (required for mailpit and other
unauthenticated relays; setting creds against a server that does not
implement SMTP AUTH raises `SMTPNotSupportedError`).
`SmtpConfigService.is_configured()` is the source of truth for "should
we tell the user an email is coming?" — inspect it, not `EMAIL_BACKEND`.

## Security invariants

* **No enumeration.** Request endpoint always returns 200. Confirm
  endpoint uses a single opaque 400 for unknown / used / expired.
* **Single-use tokens.** Marked `is_used=True` on consumption.
* **Only the latest link works.** Prior unused tokens for a user are
  bulk-invalidated every time a new reset is requested.
* **Time-bound.** `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_TTL` (default 15 min).
* **Throttled.** `5/hour` per `ip|email`.
* **Session kill on every password change.** Reset, self-service
  change, admin reset, and CLI reset all blacklist every outstanding
  refresh token for the user. Access tokens expire on their own
  (≤ `JWT_ACCESS_MINUTES`).
* **Strength enforced uniformly.** Every entry point runs Django's
  `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`, via the same
  `AuthValidationService._validate_password_field`.
* **Alphabet restricted.** Passwords must consist only of printable
  ASCII excluding whitespace (bytes 0x21–0x7E): Latin letters, digits,
  and standard symbols `!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_` `` ` `` `{|}~`.
  Enforced uniformly by `PrintableAsciiPasswordValidator` plugged into
  `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`. Email fields likewise reject any
  whitespace character.
* **Admin gate enforced at TWO layers.** `IsSuperadmin` permission class on
  `AdminPasswordResetView` rejects non-superadmin callers with the
  project-standard 403 envelope (`code: permission_denied`) before the
  service is reached. The in-service `actor.is_superadmin` check inside
  `PasswordRecoveryService.admin_reset` stays as defense-in-depth — it
  would only fire on a programming error or a future non-HTTP caller
  forgetting to gate. Either gate alone would be sufficient; both
  together are deliberate.
* **Fail-silent email.** SMTP errors are logged, never surfaced, so the
  HTTP response stays uniform (no side-channel).

## Out of scope (future stories)

* HTML email templates.
* Per-organization admin reset (only global `is_superadmin` today).
* Audit log entries — no audit surface exists yet.
