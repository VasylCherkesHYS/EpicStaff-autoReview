"""
Layer 5 — RunnerFactory: maps ``RunType`` to a ``(Runner, Emitter)`` pair.

This is one of the two orthogonal axes in the architecture: the factory
selects *how* the work is orchestrated (Runner) while also wiring the
output transport (Emitter) that matches the runner's declared
``emitter_mode``.  The pairing here is the seam where a future per-request
streaming override can slot in without touching Runner or Emitter code.
