"""
Layer 2 — LLMClient ABC and normalized chunk models.

Wraps the LiteLLM provider API behind a single async streaming interface.
``AgentLoop`` depends only on this ABC; the concrete implementation (LiteLLM
call, provider auth, retry logic) is a follow-up plan.

Non-streaming requests must also return an ``AsyncIterator[LLMChunk]``
containing exactly one item so the loop has a single codepath regardless of
``stream`` mode.
