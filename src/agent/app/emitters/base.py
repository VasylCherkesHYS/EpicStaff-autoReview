"""
Emitter ABC: transport-agnostic output sink (Bridge pattern).

The Emitter is the Bridge between the agent execution layers (Runner,
AgentLoop) and the output transport (Redis Streams, WebSocket, etc.).
Concrete implementations differ in *when* they publish and *what* they
include.  ``RunnerFactory`` selects the implementation; neither Runner nor
AgentLoop knows which one is active.

Hooks mirror the lifecycle of a single ``AgentLoop`` execution:
``on_start`` → (``on_chunk`` / ``on_tool_call`` / ``on_tool_result`` /
``on_warning``) * N → ``on_final`` | ``on_error``.
``on_warning`` may fire at any point between ``on_start`` and
``on_final`` / ``on_error``; it is advisory and must never raise.
