"""
Layer 3 support — StopPolicy: pluggable termination strategy for ``AgentLoop``.

The stop policy is the single decision point that tells the loop whether to
perform another LLM call or return.  Runners inject an appropriate policy
when constructing the loop invocation, keeping termination logic out of both
the loop body and the runner.  ``StopDecision`` carries both the boolean and
the human-readable stop reason so the loop no longer needs to classify the
reason separately.
