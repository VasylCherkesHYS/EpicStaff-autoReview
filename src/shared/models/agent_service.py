"""
Contract DTOs for the agent microservice request/response cycle.

These frozen models are the single source of truth shared between the agent
service producer (django_app / DataLoader) and the agent service consumer
(AgentLoop, Emitter, AgentResolver).

Hierarchy
---------
``AgentRequest``        — top-level envelope produced by ``DataLoader``.
    ``AgentSpec``           — per-agent configuration with resource references.
    ``BaseToolData``        — (imported from shared.models.tools) pool entry.
    ``CollectionSpec``      — pool entry for a source collection with one or more RAGs.
        ``SearchConfigEntry``   — one RAG strategy within a collection.
    ``S3FileSpec``          — pool entry for an S3-hosted file.
``RunType``             — execution-mode enum; kept here so no agent→shared dep exists.
``LoopResult``          — summary returned by ``AgentLoop.run``.
``ToolResult``          — outcome of a single tool execution.
``ContextAttachment``   — message injected before the first LLM call.
