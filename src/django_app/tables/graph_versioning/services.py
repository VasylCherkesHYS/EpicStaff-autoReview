        """
        Restore a graph to the state captured in ``version``.

        The entire operation runs inside a single ``@transaction.atomic`` block.
        Any exception raised during restoration rolls back all database changes —
        including the auto-backup row — and propagates to the caller; the dict is
        never returned in that case.

        Parameters
        ----------
        version:
            The ``GraphVersion`` snapshot to restore from.
        backup:
            When ``True``, a named ``GraphVersion`` snapshot of the *current*
            graph state is created before the restore takes place, so the
            caller can undo the operation if needed.

        Returns
        -------
        dict with keys:

        - ``restored`` (bool): always ``True`` when returned.
        - ``graph_id`` (int): primary key of the graph that was restored.
        - ``warnings`` (list): dependency warnings produced during restoration
          (e.g. nodes whose dependencies were not found and were therefore
          skipped/fk nulled from the snapshot).
        - ``auto_backup_version_id`` (int | None): primary key of the
          auto-backup ``GraphVersion`` row created when ``backup=True``.
          This key is ``None`` when ``backup=False``. Because the method is
          atomic, if it is present and non-None the transaction has committed
          successfully and the ID is a valid database row.
